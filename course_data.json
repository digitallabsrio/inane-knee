  "course_name": "Data Structures with Generic Types in Python - Free Interactive Course",
  "course_overview": "Data structures and algorithms are essential in computer science since they play a crucial role in efficient information retrieval and processing, dealing with files, storing contacts on phones, social networks and web searches.\n\nIn this course, you’ll learn about the array-based implementation of various linear data structures, stack, and queues. You’ll also learn about linked list-based implementation. Next, you’ll explore advanced data structures like skiplists and hashing. You’ll learn how to implement a variety of trees and graphs, and data structures related to bits of an integer. Toward the end of the course, you’ll learn the implementation of structures based on external storage.\n\nAfter completing this course, you’ll be able to create reusable programs with template-based collections that can efficiently analyze how to optimize the storage and retrieval of very large amounts of data. Overall, this course will enhance your productivity and performance as a software developer.",
